//Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islan
//ds. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands 
//horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all su
//rrounded by water. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: grid = [
//  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
//  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
//  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
//]
//Output: 1
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: grid = [
//  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
//  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
//]
//Output: 3
