//You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of st
//ones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The 
//one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn 
//to remove the stones. 
//
// Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a
// function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones i
//n the heap.

//me;

//s be 
//             removed by your friend. Related Topics 脑筋急转弯 极小化极大
